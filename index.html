                    Thanks to extensive coverage from Propublica's <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/driven-into-debt"> Driven into Debt</a> journalistic series, we have come to learn a lot about how Chicago's financially strained residents are disproportionately affected by debt from traffic ticketing practices.

                    Since 2007, Chicagoans have racked up almost $600M in traffic violation related debts. Though this tells us about the state of the Chicagoans as a collective, it can be difficult to assess the burden being carried by individual Chicagoans.

                  <div class="title"> Debt Burden as % of Monthly Income </div>
                  Over the course of a driver's violation history, it can be useful to measure the sum of fines over a short period of time, say, within a month. Taking the sum of fines in a month as a percent of monthly income, we can get a sense of how burdensome ticket fines can become for drivers. Each dot represents 100 people.

                    <div class="title"> Less Than 25% of Monthly Income </div>
                    The vast majority of drivers accrued at most 25% of monthly income within a 30 day period.

                  <div class="title"> Between 25% and 40% of Monthly Income </div>
                  Ninety-four thousand drivers accrued a proportion of fines equivalent to a month's housing expenses. According to rules for Section 8 housing vouchers used by low-income beneficiaries, sources suggest they spend between 30% and 40% of income on housing.

                    Fifty-two thousand drivers accured a sum as much as twice the cost of recommended housing expenses.

                    Sixteen-thousand people accrued tickets in nearly equivalent amounts to the drivers monthly income or more.
